# üé• Netflix 90s Edition üé•  

Welcome to a nostalgic trip back in time when VHS tapes, DVDs, chat rooms, and dial-up ruled the digital world!

## üëã About Me  
Hi! I‚Äôm just someone who grew up during the golden age of **dial-up internet**, **floppy disks**, and **Blockbuster nights**.  I have a deep love for the 90s web era and wanted to recreate a piece of it for others to enjoy.

## üåü About the Project  
This project is part of **Track 1 - Dot-com Boom**, and the theme revolves around early websites during the dot-com boom era.  

It‚Äôs **Netflix, but not the Netflix you know today**. Think of Netflix from the 90s:  

- When **VHS tapes** and **DVDs** were king.  
- When people hung out in **chat rooms**.  
- When websites were filled with **GIFs**, **marquees**, and **neon text**.

## Why Build This?
I wanted to bring a piece of the early web back to life. The 90s web was messy, fun, and unapologetically quirky, and that‚Äôs the spirit I wanted to capture. Netflix started its journey in 1997, delivering movies in your mailbox, and I wanted to celebrate that era with this project.

This site is less about being polished and more about fun, nostalgia, and a love letter to the dot-com boom.

## Let‚Äôs Get Nostalgic!
This project is all about remembering simpler times:

When streaming wasn‚Äôt a thing, but DVDs in your mailbox were.
When websites didn‚Äôt have to be fast, but they sure had personality.
Let‚Äôs relive the 90s together!
